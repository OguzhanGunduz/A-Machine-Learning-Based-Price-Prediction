# A-Machine-Learning-Based-Price-Prediction

Airbnb is a major platform company that connects hosts and guests. In this widely used
platform, determining the most suitable house prices for guests is of utmost importance for hosts.
Regression modeling is a popular technique in machine learning used for prediction modeling. It
is commonly employed to explore causal relationships between variables and conduct prediction
analysis. The aim of this project is to predict housing listing prices for Istanbul Airbnb using
various machine learning regression methods. Four regression models have been selected for
this study: Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression, and
Gradient Boosting Regression. Based on the results obtained, the Random Forest Regression
model has been identified as the most accurate model for predicting prices in this dataset
Keywords: Machine learning, Regression model, R-squared.
